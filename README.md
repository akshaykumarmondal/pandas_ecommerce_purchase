# E-commerce Purchase Dataset Analysis Project

I've acquired an E-commerce purchase dataset from Kaggle to enhance my Pandas skills. The goal is to practice data analysis and address specific case study questions.

## Project Overview

I will be working with an E-commerce dataset, and my objectives include:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Dive into the dataset to understand its structure, features, and general statistics.

2. **Case Study Questions:** Formulate and answer specific questions to derive insights from the data. This involves leveraging Pandas for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset Columns**
  - 'Address': The customer's billing address.
  - 'Lot': A unique identifier for the purchase.
  - 'AM or PM': Indicates whether the purchase was made in the morning or afternoon.
  - 'Browser Info': Information about the customer's web browser.
  - 'Company': The customer's workplace or company name.
  - 'Credit Card': The credit card number used for the purchase.

  - 'Purchase Price': The amount spent on the purchase.
